# Morr_Assignment

## How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

... I chooses React to develop Frontend Application beacuse it is quite simple and famous JavaScript library among developers handled by open source community.
...React helps in managing the data without updating the Real Dom because React updated in Virtual Dom.
... Here I used create-react-app for getting proper folder structure. Although I hadn't used any Bootstrap library as mentioned in the docs.

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

... I will improve the UI and also I would like to manage my state with context API.

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

... If I had more time I wil surely improve the User Interface.
... I will also improve the folder structure adding Context API.
... If I had more time then I will definitely try to make different small small modules so that it is easy to make my aplication more modular, easifying, solving bugs, easy to test etc.
